With the proliferation of AI development tools like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot, software development productivity has significantly improved. AI-specific techniques and knowledge, such as context preparation methods and prompt engineering, are being actively shared.

However, now that AI development tools have become widespread, what truly matters in system development is **selecting effective principles for projects, establishing governance, and utilizing fundamental technologies such as static analysis tools like linters to detect defects**.

## Changes Brought by AI Development Tools

AI development tools are undeniably powerful. Claude Code can implement complex logic in a short time, and GitHub Copilot quickly generates repetitive code. However, these tools assist with **"how to build"** rather than **"what to build"**.

Code generated by AI does not necessarily guarantee:

- **Compliance with project architecture principles**
- **Adherence to team-agreed coding conventions**
- **Application of security best practices**
- **Designs that consider maintainability and extensibility**

## The Importance of Fundamental Technologies

### 1. Selecting Principles and Establishing Governance

The success of a project requires selecting appropriate principles. For example:

- **Design Principles**: SOLID principles, DRY principle, YAGNI principle
- **Architecture Patterns**: Layered architecture, microservices, event-driven design
- **Security Principles**: Principle of least privilege, defense in depth, secure by design

AI tools do not automatically apply these principles. **Developers have the responsibility to select principles suitable for the project and apply them as governance across the team**.

In the financial trading system I worked on, we selected the following principles for multi-tenant architecture:

- Strict data isolation using PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS)
- Dynamic access control using AWS Dynamic Policy
- IAM role design based on the principle of least privilege

These principles were agreed upon by the entire team and enforced through code reviews, rather than relying on AI tools.

### 2. Quality Assurance Through Static Analysis

Even for code generated by AI, quality assurance is essential. In fact, precisely because the code is generated by AI, objective checks using static analysis tools become more important.

**ESLint / Prettier**

```typescript
// Even AI-generated code must comply with team conventions
// through lint rules
export function processData(data: any) {
  // ❌ Use of 'any' prohibited
  return data.map((item) => item.value) // ❌ Implicit 'any' prohibited
}

// Corrected version complying with lint rules
export function processData(data: DataItem[]): number[] {
  return data.map((item) => item.value)
}
```

**pytest / Test Automation**

In the project I built, we established an automated testing infrastructure using pytest. Code generated by AI was also required to pass the following tests:

- Unit tests (function/class level)
- Integration tests (module interactions)
- End-to-end tests (actual use cases)

We aimed for a test coverage of over 70% and ensured quality by automatically running tests in the CI/CD pipeline.

### 3. Continuous Quality Management with CI/CD

While AI tools improve productivity, **automation through Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)** is essential for maintaining quality.

Example of the CI/CD pipeline I built:

```yaml
# Automation flow with CodePipeline
1. On PR Creation
- Static analysis (ESLint, Prettier, ruff)
- Unit test execution (pytest, vitest)
- Test coverage check

2. On Merge
- Build execution
- Integration test execution
- Automatic deployment (staging environment)

3. On Release
- E2E test execution
- Production environment deployment
- Team notification via Slack
```

This pipeline ensures that both AI-generated code and human-written code are subjected to the same quality standards.

## The Role of Developers in the AI Era

The role of developers is changing with the advent of AI development tools. However, the essence remains unchanged:

### Responsibilities Developers Should Bear

1. **Architecture Design**: Selecting design principles and patterns appropriate for the project
2. **Establishing Governance**: Formulating and enforcing rules that the entire team should follow
3. **Systematizing Quality Assurance**: Setting up static analysis, test automation, and CI/CD
4. **Ensuring Security**: Conducting vulnerability assessments and security reviews
5. **Managing Technical Debt**: Refactoring and maintaining documentation

AI tools **assist with implementation**, but they do not **replace judgment**.

## Practical Example: Balancing AI Development Environment and Quality Assurance

I'll share an example from my work on a financial trading system.

### Introducing AI Development Environment

- Built an AI development environment centered on **Claude Code (Bedrock)**
- Achieved implementation-level code generation with custom prompts
- Improved productivity with code completion using GitHub Copilot

### Establishing Quality Assurance Framework

Simultaneously, we established the following quality assurance framework:

1. **DevContainer**: Reduced environment-related bugs through development environment standardization
2. **pytest**: Improved test coverage through automated testing infrastructure
3. **ruff**: Detected convention violations through Python code static analysis
4. **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment with CodePipeline + CodeBuild

As a result, we achieved both productivity improvements through AI tools and high-quality standards.

## Conclusion

AI development tools are powerful, but they alone do not guarantee project success. **Fundamental technologies such as selecting effective principles for projects, establishing governance, and quality assurance through static analysis** remain critically important in the AI era.

In fact, as the volume of AI-generated code increases, the importance of these fundamental technologies becomes even greater. Effectively utilizing AI tools while ensuring quality through fundamental technologies—only with both wheels can sustainable software development be achieved.
