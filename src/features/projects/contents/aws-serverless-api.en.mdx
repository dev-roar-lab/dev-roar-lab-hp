## Project Overview

Built a fully serverless API platform on AWS to handle large-scale traffic. By migrating from an EC2-based system, we significantly reduced operational costs and improved scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Lambda**: Business logic implementation
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API endpoint management
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database
- **CloudFormation**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Python 3.11**: Lambda function implementation
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Key Features

### 1. Scalable API Design

Lambda auto-scaling enables flexible response to traffic spikes. Achieved stable performance through concurrent execution control and provisioned concurrency settings.

### 2. Security Measures

- Authentication and authorization with API Gateway (Lambda Authorizer)
- IAM roles following principle of least privilege
- Secure communication using VPC endpoints
- Monitoring and alerting with CloudWatch Logs

### 3. Cost Optimization

Reduced monthly operational costs by **60%** compared to the previous EC2-based system.

```python
# Lambda function example
import json
import boto3
from typing import Dict, Any

dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
table = dynamodb.Table('users')

def lambda_handler(event: Dict[str, Any], context: Any) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    try:
        user_id = event['pathParameters']['id']
        response = table.get_item(Key={'userId': user_id})

        if 'Item' not in response:
            return {
                'statusCode': 404,
                'body': json.dumps({'error': 'User not found'})
            }

        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps(response['Item'])
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            'statusCode': 500,
            'body': json.dumps({'error': str(e)})
        }
```

## Results

- **Performance**: Maintained average response time under 50ms
- **Cost Reduction**: 60% reduction in monthly operational costs
- **Availability**: Achieved 99.99% uptime
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling 1000 requests per second

## Lessons Learned

Learned the importance of production-ready optimizations in serverless architecture design, including cold start mitigation and DynamoDB capacity planning. Implementing IaC with CloudFormation enabled reproducible infrastructure deployment.
