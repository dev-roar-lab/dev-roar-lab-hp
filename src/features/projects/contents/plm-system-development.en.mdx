## Project Overview

Worked on contract development of systems using PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) packages for the manufacturing industry. Responsible for Aras Innovator customization, web application development using ASP.NET Core, AWS infrastructure construction and operations, CI/CD pipeline implementation, and customer in-house development support.

## Responsibilities

### Aras Innovator Customization

- **Method customization development**: Business logic implementation
- **XML-based export/import deployment approach**: Established efficient deployment methods
- **Method testing methodology establishment**: Built quality assurance processes
- **Deployment management systematization**: Improved operational efficiency through automation
- **Configuration file change manual creation**: Documentation maintenance

### Web Application Development

- Web application development using **ASP.NET Core 3.0**
- Implementation of Excel-like UI that could not be achieved with Aras
- Data integration design and implementation between Aras and web applications
- Data management using **PostgreSQL**

### Infrastructure Construction and Operations

- **AWS infrastructure construction** (EC2, RDS, VPC)
- Multi-environment deployment and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using **Terraform**
- Operations with **Alpine Linux containers**

### CI/CD Implementation

- Built CI/CD pipeline using **AWS CodePipeline** and CodeBuild
- Implemented automated testing, deployment, and Slack notifications when a PR is created

### Customer Support

- Explained critical technical issues and proposed solutions
- Supported and educated customers for in-house development

## Technologies Used

### Languages & Frameworks

- **C#**: Business logic implementation
- **ASP.NET Core 3.0**: Web application development
- **XML**: Aras Method export/import

### Database

- **PostgreSQL**: Data management

### Infrastructure & Cloud

- **AWS EC2**: Application servers
- **AWS RDS**: Database servers
- **AWS VPC**: Network configuration
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Alpine Linux**: Container environment

### CI/CD & Development Tools

- **AWS CodePipeline**: Automated deployment pipeline
- **AWS CodeBuild**: Build and test automation
- **Slack**: Notification integration

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

Automated infrastructure deployment to multiple environments (development, staging, production) using Terraform. Improved reproducibility and maintainability by managing infrastructure configuration as code.

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Construction

Achieved the following by combining AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild:

- Automatic deployment of web applications
- Automated unit test execution when a PR is created
- Information sharing across the team via Slack notifications

Achieved stable quality and increased deployment frequency through automated deployment and test execution.

### 3. Aras Method Deployment Process Establishment

Proposed and implemented XML-based export/import approach to streamline Aras Method deployment process. Significantly reduced operational overhead through deployment management systematization.

### 4. Customer In-house Development Support

Supported customers' autonomous operations through technical knowledge sharing and documentation. Contributed to improving customer team's technical capabilities through educational programs.

## Results

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Reduced operational and maintenance costs through multi-environment deployment with Terraform
- **CI/CD Pipeline Construction**: Achieved automated deployment and test execution
- **Aras Method Deployment Efficiency**: Established XML-based deployment approach
- **Customer In-house Development Support**: Achieved autonomous customer team operations and improved customer satisfaction

## Lessons Learned

Acquired domain knowledge specific to the manufacturing industry through PLM systems and practical skills in AWS infrastructure construction and operations. Learned DevOps best practices through Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and CI/CD pipeline construction. Through customer in-house development support, I realized the importance of technical knowledge transfer and documentation.
