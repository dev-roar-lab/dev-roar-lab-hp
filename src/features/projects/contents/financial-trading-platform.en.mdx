## Project Overview

As Tech Leader at a financial company, I was responsible for developing and operating Proprietary Trading Systems (PTS). For the equity PTS, I conducted maintenance and enhancement of the existing system, while for the security token PTS, I was involved from the initial launch phase. Developed external-facing web systems and back-office operation systems, building a secure operational foundation with multi-tenant architecture.

## Responsibilities

### System Development

- Design and development of external-facing web systems
- Development of back-office operation systems
- Multi-tenant authentication and authorization design

### Development Environment Setup

- Setup development environment with DevContainer
- Built test infrastructure (pytest) and test automation
- Implemented CI/CD pipeline with CodePipeline and CodeBuild

### Development Leadership

- Technology selection and development standard establishment
- Code review and quality management
- AI-driven development environment promotion (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot)
- Team management (up to 9 members)

## Technologies Used

### Languages & Frameworks

- **Python 3.10**: Backend API and in-house library development
- **Next.js**: Back-office web application development
- **OpenAPI Specification**: API specification definition and API Gateway construction

### Infrastructure & Cloud

- **AWS Lambda**: API and batch processing (Lambda-first approach)
- **AWS CodePipeline / CodeBuild**: Automated ruff validation, pytest execution, and deployment
- **AWS API Gateway**: API endpoint management, integration with Authorizer
- **AWS Cognito**: Authentication and authorization for external systems
- **AWS Dynamic Policy**: Dynamic access control
- **Docker**: Development environment containerization (DevContainer), sandbox provisioning for DB and API

### Database

- **PostgreSQL**: Multi-tenant data isolation (Row Level Security)

### Development Tools

- **Git**: Version control (CodeCommit, GitHub), integration with CI/CD
- **pytest**: Unit and integration test execution
- **Playwright**: Regression test execution
- **ruff**: Python linter/formatter
- **Claude Code / GitHub Copilot**: AI-driven development
- **Asana / Jira**: Ticket management
- **Backlog**: Knowledge aggregation

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Multi-tenant Architecture Design

Implemented strict tenant-based data and access isolation using PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) and AWS Dynamic Policy. Achieved a multi-tenant system that balances security and maintainability.

### 2. AI-Driven Development Environment

Introduced AI development environment centered on Claude Code (Bedrock). Achieved implementation-level code generation with custom prompts, improving development efficiency.

### 3. Quality Assurance Framework

- Improved developer experience by promoting static analysis benefits through DevContainer setup
- Built testing infrastructure with pytest (unit test automation, integration test scripting)
- Achieved improved test coverage and stable quality

## Role

**Tech Leader**

- Responsible for all phases: requirement definition, design, implementation, testing, and operations
- Technology selection, development standard establishment, and code review
- Creation and improvement of ticket management rules, knowledge base maintenance and operational rule creation and improvement

## Results

- Achieved stable operation of financial trading systems
- Built secure operational foundation with multi-tenant architecture
- Improved development efficiency through AI-driven development adoption
- Established quality assurance framework with DevContainer, test automation, and CI/CD

## Lessons Learned

Through advanced security requirements in financial systems and multi-tenant architecture design and implementation, I gained enterprise-level system development expertise. I also learned effective utilization of AI development tools and the importance of quality management in team development.
