## Project Overview

As Tech Leader at a financial IT company, I was responsible for launching and operating trading systems for Proprietary Trading System (PTS) and security token markets. Developed external-facing web systems and back-office operation systems for securities companies and asset management firms, building an efficient operational foundation with multi-tenant architecture.

## Responsibilities

### System Development

- Design and development of external-facing web systems
- Development of back-office operation systems
- Multi-tenant authentication and authorization design

### Development Environment Setup

- Standardized development environment with DevContainer
- Built test infrastructure (pytest) and test automation
- Implemented CI/CD pipeline with CodePipeline and CodeBuild

### Development Leadership

- Technology selection and development standard establishment
- Code review and quality management
- AI-driven development environment promotion (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot)
- Team management (up to 9 members)

## Technologies Used

### Languages & Frameworks

- **Python 3.9**: Backend API development (in-house library)
- **TypeScript**: Frontend development
- **Next.js**: Web application framework
- **Node.js**: Server-side processing

### Infrastructure & Cloud

- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless function execution
- **AWS CodePipeline**: CI/CD pipeline
- **AWS CodeBuild**: Build automation
- **AWS API Gateway**: API endpoint management
- **AWS Dynamic Policy**: Dynamic access control
- **Docker (devcontainer)**: Development environment containerization
- **Hybrid cloud architecture** (AWS + on-premises)

### Database

- **PostgreSQL**: Multi-tenant data isolation with RLS (Row Level Security)

### Development Tools

- **Git** (CodeCommit, GitHub)
- **pytest**: Python testing framework
- **ruff**: Python linter/formatter
- **Claude Code (Bedrock)**: AI-driven development
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Multi-tenant Architecture Design

Implemented strict tenant-based data and access isolation using PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) and AWS Dynamic Policy. Achieved a multi-tenant system that balances security and maintainability.

### 2. AI-Driven Development Environment

Introduced AI development environment centered on Claude Code (Bedrock). Achieved implementation-level code generation with custom prompts, improving development efficiency.

### 3. Quality Assurance Framework

- Reduced environment-related bugs through DevContainer standardization
- Built automated testing infrastructure with pytest (unit tests and integration tests)
- Continuous integration and delivery through CI/CD pipeline
- Achieved improved test coverage and stable quality

## Role

**Tech Leader**

- Responsible for all phases: requirement definition, design, implementation, testing, and operations
- Technology selection, development standard establishment, and code review
- Team management (up to 9 members)

## Results

- Achieved stable operation of financial trading systems
- Built efficient operational foundation with multi-tenant architecture
- Improved development efficiency through AI-driven development adoption
- Established quality assurance framework with DevContainer, test automation, and CI/CD

## Lessons Learned

Through advanced security requirements in financial systems and multi-tenant architecture design and implementation, I gained enterprise-level system development expertise. I also learned effective utilization of AI development tools and the importance of quality management in team development.
